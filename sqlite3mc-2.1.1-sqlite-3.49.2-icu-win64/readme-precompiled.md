# Release notes

May 8, 2025

The SQLite3 shell applications are compatible with the official
SQLite3 shell in respect to the compile time options
`SQLITE_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB`, `SQLITE_ENABLE_STMTVTAB`, and
`SQLITE_ENABLE_UNKNOWN_SQL_FUNCTION`.

Separate archives are provided _with_ resp. _without_ enabled ICU support
for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.

ICU support for SQLite3 is currently based on the pre-built ICU
Libraries v76.1, which were compiled with Visual Studio 2022.
The required ICU DLLs are included in the archives in folder `bin`.
They were downloaded from

https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/releases/tag/release-76-1

In addition, the Visual C++ 2022 runtime is required to be installed,
because the ICU DLLs depend on it.

## Archive content

Archive names:

1) `sqlite3mc-u.v.w-sqlite-x.y.z-win32.zip` - 32-bit Windows without ICU support
2) `sqlite3mc-u.v.w-sqlite-x.y.z-win64.zip` - 64-bit Windows without ICU support
3) `sqlite3mc-u.v.w-sqlite-x.y.z-icu-win32.zip` - 32-bit Windows with ICU support
4) `sqlite3mc-u.v.w-sqlite-x.y.z-icu-win64.zip` - 64-bit Windows with ICU support

where `u.v.w` designates the version of _SQLite3 Multiple Ciphers_ and
`x.y.z` designates the version of the _SQLite3_ library.
